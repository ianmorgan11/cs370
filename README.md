What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Some ethical responsibilities to the user are data protection and consent. Allow the user to agree to data collection and show them what is being collected as well as keep that data safe from outsiders. This also extends to the organization as if there is an issue violating the user, there may be laws that can harm the organization from operating.
